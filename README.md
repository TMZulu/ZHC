**ZHC** is an Arma 3 headless client system designed to be flexible and efficient for both large and small communities. It is designed to be completely flexible with features and functionality through the use of CBA Settings and Keybinds.

**ZHC** was initially created for and tested under The Myrmidon Legion's 700th Cadian. It was developed and kept within the community & unit until it was in a state that was ready for release to the greater Arma community. This release has been transferred from a larger framework. Some bugs may have occurred in the process. Please report any [`here`](https://github.com/TMZulu/ZHC/issues).
